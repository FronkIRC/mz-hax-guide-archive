Step I - Getting milanzombieHAX setup

1. Insert your Wii's SD Card to your PC.
2. Then, go to https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030114991 and download MZHAXInstaller.zip.
3. Open MZHAXINSTALL.bat and let it install by itself. It should've made a folder called MZUS_Out.
4. Enter the MZUS_Out folder and find the payloader folder. 
5. Drag mzhaxload.wiix to the root of your SD card. Eject the SD card and put it back in the Wii.

Step II - Installing milanzombieHAX

1. If your Wii boots up with a black screen and a text saying 'milanzombieHAX' appears, it means it was successful.
- If you did not get a screen like that and you instantly booted to the System Menu, reboot your Wii and try again.
2. milanzombieHAX will install The Homebrew Channel and some default apps for the Homebrew Channel.
3. Your Wii should say a message 'HAXXED by Milanzombie! :) Successful!'. If it doesn't go cry in a corner try rebooting your Wii.

Step III - Finalizing MZHax

1. Boot into HBC and find the app called milanzombiefirm Installer.
2. Let it install CFW on your Wii. You will get new apps too!
3. That's all! milanzombieHAX has been successfully installed on your Wii and 3DS, Wii U, and DSi.
